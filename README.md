====================

Getting Started
---------------

After you have cloned this repo, run this setup script to set up your machine
with the necessary dependencies to run and test this app:

    % ./bin/setup

It assumes you have a machine equipped with Ruby, Postgres, etc.

After setting up, you can run the application using [foreman]:

    % foreman start

If you don't have `foreman`, see [Foreman's install instructions][foreman]. It
is [purposefully excluded from the project's `Gemfile`][exclude].
